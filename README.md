## nvQuickPersonaBar
This is a collection of Visual Studio solutions to help you get started with DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) Persona Bar extension development.
Each solution is a simple starter using a particular development pattern.  A common misconception about Persona Bar extension development
is that you must know and use React.  That is simply not true.  Perhaps it is due to the fact that core DNN Platform Personal Bar extensions 
do use React.  In particular, they leverage the [Dnn.React.Common Library](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.React.Common), which contains 
reusable React components.  The purpose of **nvQuickPersonaBar** is to provide a quick start solution regardless of the JavaScript framework 
you choose to use (or not use).

### Simple HTML
This is an HTML only Persona Bar extension and does not require knowledge of React, or any other framework for that matter.  The only 
JavaScript is the required boilerplate code for any Persona Bar extension.

### Simple Vue
This is a VueJs Persona Bar extension and does not require knowledge of React.  JavaScript is the required boilerplate code for any Persona Bar extension.  The remaining is all VueJs.  This particular extension uses VueJs with Babel, Typescript, CSS Pre-processors and a Linter / Formatter.

### Simple Angular
This is an Angular Persona Bar extension and does not require knowledge of React.  JavaScript is the required boilerplate code for any Persona Bar extension.  The remaining is all Angular.  This particular extension uses Angular with Typescript and TSLint.
